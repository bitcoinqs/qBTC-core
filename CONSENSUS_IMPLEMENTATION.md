# Consensus Implementation Summary

## Overview

The qBTC blockchain now implements a proper consensus mechanism with the following features:

1. **Chain Reorganization**: Automatic switching to the chain with highest cumulative proof-of-work
2. **Fork Resolution**: Uses the "longest chain rule" (actually highest cumulative difficulty)
3. **Orphan Block Management**: Stores and connects orphan blocks when their parents arrive
4. **Chain State Tracking**: Maintains active chain tips and block index

## Key Components

### 1. ChainManager (`blockchain/chain_manager.py`)

The central component that handles:
- Block validation and addition
- Fork detection and resolution
- Chain reorganization
- Orphan block management
- Chain tip tracking

Key methods:
- `add_block()`: Validates and adds new blocks, triggers reorgs if needed
- `get_best_chain_tip()`: Returns the current best chain (highest cumulative PoW)
- `_reorganize_to_block()`: Performs chain reorganization
- `_find_common_ancestor()`: Finds fork point between competing chains
- `is_block_in_main_chain()`: Checks if a block is in the active chain

### 2. Updated Sync Module (`sync/sync.py`)

- Uses ChainManager for all block processing
- Only processes transactions for blocks in the main chain
- Handles orphan blocks automatically
- Provides blockchain info via `get_blockchain_info()`

### 3. Integration Points

- **RPC**: Added `getblockchaininfo` method to query chain state
- **Gossip**: Blocks received from peers go through ChainManager
- **Database**: Updated to optionally use ChainManager for current height

## How It Works

1. **New Block Arrives**: ChainManager validates PoW and structure
2. **Parent Check**: If parent missing, block becomes orphan
3. **Fork Detection**: If block creates competing chain, compare cumulative difficulty
4. **Reorganization**: If new chain is better:
   - Find common ancestor
   - Disconnect blocks from old chain (revert transactions)
   - Connect blocks from new chain (apply transactions)
5. **Orphan Processing**: When block added, check if any orphans can now connect

## Example Scenarios

### Simple Fork Resolution
```
Initial: A → B → C
Fork:    A → B → D → E

Result: Chain switches to A → B → D → E (longer chain)
```

### Orphan Block Handling
```
Receives: Block C (parent B not found)
Status: C becomes orphan
Receives: Block B
Result: B connected, then C automatically connected
```

### Deep Reorganization
```
Main:    A → B → C → D → E
Fork:    A → B → X → Y → Z → W

Result: Reorg from E back to B, then forward to W
```

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Prevents chain splits and ensures consensus
2. **Resilience**: Handles network partitions and delayed blocks
3. **Compatibility**: Works with existing UTXO and transaction systems
4. **Performance**: In-memory index for fast lookups

## Testing

Run consensus tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_consensus.py -v
```

The test suite covers:
- Chain extension
- Orphan blocks
- Fork resolution
- Deep reorganization
- Invalid block rejection
- Multiple chain tips
- Common ancestor finding
